I am currently a mathematics student at the University of Helsinki interested in the interaction between derived categories, complex and algebraic geometry. More specifically in stability conditions, such as Bridgeland stability and K-stability. This blog is just a space for me to jot down and organize topics that catch my interest. All of the posts here will be informal.
