This is going to be a short one on some line bundles over the projective space $\Bbb P^n$. I'll try to be elaborate on their spaces of sections as well as later delve bit on divisors possibly in the case of Riemann surfaces.

We'll begin with the simplest line bundle one can consider which we'll denote by $\mathcal{O}(-1)$ for reasons that become apparent soon. Define $\mathcal{O}(-) \to \Bbb P^n$ as the subbundle

$$
\mathcal{O}(-1) = \{(\ell, z) \in \Bbb P^n \times \Bbb C^{n+1} \mid z \in  \ell\},
$$

of the bundle $\Bbb P^n \times \Bbb C^{n+1}$.

<div class="proposition">
The bundle $\mathcal{O}(-1) \to \Bbb P^n$ is a holomorphic line bundle.
</div>

<div class="proof">
Consider the usual cover for $\Bbb P^n$ given by the open sets $U_\alpha = \{[z^0,\dots,z^n] \in \Bbb P^n \mid z^\alphaÂ \ne 0 \}$.
