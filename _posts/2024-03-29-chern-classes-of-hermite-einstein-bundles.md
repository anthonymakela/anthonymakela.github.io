I'm planning on writing about Calabi-Yau manifolds in the upcoming future, but before I do that there is a loose end I would like to tie up. Last time we discussed vector bundles admitting Hermite-Einstein metrics. Today we'll be looking at the Chern classes of such bundles. This is going to be a relatively short one, but since they impose certain conditions on the flatness of the bundle and that is mainly the question I'm interested in at the moment, I want to go over this.
